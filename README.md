# SurvAI - The Survey Options Generator

An effiecient and accurate Survey Options Generator implemented using state-of-the-art model BERT.

Survey generations can be made much quicker and more efficient by making use of deep learning models for automatic generation of answer fields. Some survey questions take standard options mostly, some take text answers, some take single selection/multi-selection answers, etc. Therefore manual selection of answer type fields for questions can be automated using AI for greater efficiency

SurvAI is an AI-based option generator that makes use of BERT transformers and predicts accurate answer types depending on the question we need as a part of our survey. This method is efficient, and it also saves time by generating the appropriate input type for the entered question without the manual selection necessity!

The data acquisition and web scraping has been done carefully from selected websites and the final dataset has been modified as per our requirement for data analysis.
